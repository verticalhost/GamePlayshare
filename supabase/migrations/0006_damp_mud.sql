  # Avatar Storage Setup

  1. Storage Configuration
    - Create avatars bucket for profile pictures
    - Set up RLS policies for avatar access and uploads

  2. Security
    - Enable public read access for avatars
    - Restrict uploads to authenticated users
    - Ensure users can only update their own avatars
